#VDD: my version of Visual Driven Development
This is an experiment where I use TDD to develop coding units and behaviours by writing tests first.
I use SpecFlow as my BDD tool to perform browser based integration tests against a fully deployed running system. 
For me BDD sits strongly within the QA domain and maps nicely when documenting features and scenarios.

##My Concept
We (my current company) currently use Selenium WebDriver to run Chrome and FireFox browser Automation Tests 
which is notifying us of regression and highlights some user interface design issues.  

One thing that we kept missing in terms of regression was spotting visual elements that change.  
A simple CSS change can be catastrophic for another view that has some css hacks.
The Selenium WebDriver will continue to perform and run tests despite the page looking visually corrupt.

This is a research library using AForge.Net Framework ([http://code.google.com/p/aforge/](http://code.google.com/p/aforge/)). The idea to a create a set of expected images for different parts
of the application that we can compare during a running test.

##Stuff to know
###Exclude regions
You can add rgb regions/zones to indicate parts of the application you want to ignore during image comparison.  
The RGB region is configurable but defaults to FFFFD800.
e.g. The colour FFD800 (like yellow) is the ignore zone.

###Images currently have to be saved as png files

###Fragile Tests
It's likely some tests will fail since I'm basing them websites that are dynamically changing every day.  
As I add loads of samples I will try to find something a bit more stable.

###Image Sizes
Your default browser size may differ from mine so you might have failing tests due to mismatching image sizes.
